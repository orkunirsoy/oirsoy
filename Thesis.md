## Dynamic Analysis of False Information Spread Over Social Media
 
### Summary:   
My objective is to analyze and expand the formal SIER (Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered) models of information diffusion from the perspective of behavioral sciences. I aim to disaggregate the traditional SIER models in terms of people's motivation to share information and evaluate whether such model can create prevalent dynamic behavior for different cases such as misinformation related to health, misinformation spread during disaster management, or misinformation and its debunking for a polarizing content.
