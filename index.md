## Hello,
I recently obtained my master's degree from Industrial Engineering Department, Boğaziçi University, Turkey. I am currently working as a research & teaching assistant at the same department. Though I have a diverse set of application areas during my studies, I am particularly interested in addresssing social problems from the perspective of complex systems. Considering the methodology, my research interest lies at the intersection of data science, network science and simulation. I am usually curious about the problems that are prevalently addressed in social sciences but currently don't have solid and effective mitigation strategies. I created this page to provide examplary work from my master’s and bachelor’s studies. You can navigate using the bar at the top for more information.

Orkun.
