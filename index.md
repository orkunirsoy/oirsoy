## Hello,
I am a senior master's student and graduate research assistant at the Industrial Engineering Department, Boğaziçi University, Turkey. Though I have a diverse set of application areas during my studies, I am particularly interested in addresssing social problems from the perspective of complex systems. Methodologically, I focus on simulation modeling although I have a background in data and network analysis as an engineering graduate. I am usually curious about the problems that are prevalently addressed in social sciences but currently don't have solid and effective mitigation strategies. Currently I am working on my thesis on misinformation thus recently focused on topics regarding social media and false information spread. Feel free to take a look at other tabs to see detailed information on my work.
Orkun.
