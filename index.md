## Hello,
I am a senior master's student and graduate research assistant at the Industrial Engineering Department, Boğaziçi University, Turkey. Though I have a diverse set of application areas during my studies, I am particularly interested in addresssing social problems from the perspective of complex systems. Methodologically, I focus on simulation modeling although I have some background in data analysis and network science as an engineering graduate. I am usually curious about the problems that are prevalently addressed in social sciences but currently don't have solid and effective mitigation strategies. These days, I am working on my thesis on misinformation thus recently focused on topics regarding social media and false information spread. I created this page to provide examplary work from my master’s and bachelor’s studies. You can navigate using the bar at the top for more information.

Orkun.
