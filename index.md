## Hello,
I am a first year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University. I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Industrial Engineering from Boğaziçi University in Turkey. During my studies, I was exposed to a wide range of application areas, but I am particularly passionate about addressing social issues from a complex systems perspective. In terms of methodology, my research interests intersect data science, network science, and simulation whereas I focus on problems prevalent in social sciences such as polarization, misinformation, opinion dynamics. This page showcases exemplars of my Master's and Bachelor's work. You may use the navigation bar at the top to access further information. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any inquiries.

Orkun.
