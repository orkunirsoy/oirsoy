## Hello,
I recently obtained my Master's degree from the Industrial Engineering Department at Boğaziçi University in Turkey. I am currently working as a research and teaching assistant at the same department. Although I have a diverse set of application areas during my studies, I am particularly interested in addressing social problems from the perspective of complex systems. In terms of methodology, my research interests lie at the intersection of data science, network science, and simulation. I am usually curious about the problems that are frequently addressed in social sciences but currently lack solid and effective mitigation strategies. I created this page to provide exemplary work from my Master's and Bachelor's studies. You can use the bar at the top to navigate to more information. Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Orkun.
