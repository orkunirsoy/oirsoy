## Hello,
I recently received my Master's degree in Industrial Engineering from Boğaziçi University in Turkey. Currently, I am working as a research and teaching assistant at the same department. During my studies, I was exposed to a wide range of application areas, but I am particularly passionate about addressing social issues from a complex systems perspective. In terms of methodology, my research interests intersect data science, network science, and simulation. I am often intrigued by problems prevalent in social sciences that currently lack robust and effective solutions. This page showcases exemplars of my Master's and Bachelor's work. You may use the navigation bar at the top to access further information. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any inquiries.

Orkun.
