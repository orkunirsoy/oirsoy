## Hello,
I am a senior master's student and graduate research assistant at the Industrial Engineering Department, Boğaziçi University, Turkey. As an engineer, I am interested in solving complex problems with quantitative methods whereas as a social science enthusiast I am even keener if those problems include a human aspect. This page is created to provide examplary work from my master's and bachelor's studies. You can navigate using the bar at the top for more information.
Orkun.
