## Research
I am currently working with [Osman Yağan](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~oyagan/) on topics such as cascading failures, multiple topic opinion diffusion on social networks, early indicators of offline violence in online conspiracy theories. 
In my masters, I worked in [Socio-Economic System Dynamics Lab (SESDYN)](https://sesdyn.ie.boun.edu.tr/index_en.php), Boğaziçi University and collaborated with [DiaPols](https://diapols.com/) group about social movements on social media.

## Teaching
Between February 2020 - August 2023, I have been serving as a teaching assistant in the Industrial Engineering Department at Boğaziçi University. In this role, my responsibilities have included leading problem sessions (typically weekly or biweekly sessions focused on example solving and question and answer sessions), preparing and grading term projects, quizzes, homeworks, and other miscellaneous tasks related to the organization of courses. To date, I have worked as a TA for a number of courses that have required some combination of these tasks.
