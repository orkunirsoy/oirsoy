## Research
I am working in [Socio-Economic System Dynamics Lab (SESDYN)](http://sesdyn.ie.boun.edu.tr/index_en.php), Boğaziçi University and working with [DiaPols](https://diapols.com/) group about social movements on social media. I am also a part-time research fellow in [Karanfil Lab](http://www.karanfillab.com/).

## Teaching
Since February 2020, I am working as a teaching assistant in Industrial Engineering Department at Boğaziçi University. My responsibilities include conducting problem sessions (usually weekly or bi-weekly administered example solving and Q&A sessions), preparing / grading term projects, quizes, homeworks, and other miscellenous tasks related to the organization of the courses. So far, I've worked as TA for several courses which requires some subset of the aformentioned tasks:
