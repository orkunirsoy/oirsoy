## Teaching
Since February 2020, I am working as a teaching assistant in Industrial Engineering Department at Boğaziçi University. My responsibilities include conducting problem sessions (usually weekly or bi-weekly administered example solving and Q&A sessions), preparing / grading term projects, quizes, homeworks, and other miscellenous tasks related to the organization of the courses. So far, I've worked as TA for several courses which requires some subset of the aformentioned tasks:
- [Intermediate Programming](https://ie.boun.edu.tr/courses/ie-201-intermediate-programming) (w/Ali Tamer Ünal)
- [Operations Research II](https://ie.boun.edu.tr/courses/ie-203-operations-research-ii) (w/Zeki Caner Taşkın, Necati Aras)
- [Quality Engineering](https://ie.boun.edu.tr/sites/ie.boun.edu.tr/files/IE423_Fall16_Syllabus.pdf) (w/Könül Bayramoğlu Kavlak)
- [Systems Science & Engineering](https://ie.boun.edu.tr/courses/ie-350-systems-science-and-engineering) (w/Yaman Barlas)
- [Agent Based Simulation](https://ie.boun.edu.tr/courses/ie-588-agent-based-modelling-and-simulation) (w/Gönenç Yücel)
- [Discrete Event Simulation](https://ie.boun.edu.tr/courses/ie-306-systems-simulation) (w/Yaman Barlas)
